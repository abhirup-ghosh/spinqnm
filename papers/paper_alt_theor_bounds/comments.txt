Dear Alessandra Buonanno,

Gregorio Carullo has commented on publication "Black-hole ringdown as a probe of higher-curvature gravity theories":

   Dear Hector, Abhirup, Alessandra,

   Very interesting results!

   I have a couple of comments regarding the comparisons with Ref.[49].

   First, here I would like to note explicitly that it's hard to make
   apple-to-apple comparisons, since: i) we are using different events; ii)
   when quoting the results on \ell, I was including up to quadratic terms
   in the non-GR expansion.  Although it is an approximate one, I agree it
   makes sense to present a comparison of the results. If attempting such
   comparison, it might be good to mention the points above.

   Secondly, I do not think that what is currently written in the
   manuscript correctly represents what I presented in [49]. You write:

   "then proceeded to use the posteriors on \ell to draw conclusions to any
   theory that predict corrections at a given p"

   and

   "We can compare this conclusion with that of Ref. [49], which obtained
   l_EdGB Ùè∞Å< 35 km, by setting p = 4"

   Projecting the bounds obtained with ParSpec onto a specific theory has
   several subtleties, as you correctly discuss. For these reasons, I tried
   to (and hopefully managed to) be very careful in the way I stated the
   results obtained. Specifically, I never wrote that the bounds I obtained
   were a direct constrain on EdGB/dCS.
   I only stated that those theories would give rise to a correction which
   has the same scaling of the one I considered, nothing more [49]:

   "In this case we obtain a bound of l < 35km. Two notable examples of
   quadratic gravity theories with a QNM spectrum featuring p = 4
   corrections, are Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet(EsGB) and
   dynamical-Chern-Simons gravity (dCS)."

   Could you please amend the text to make your statements more
   representative of what I wrote?

   Thanks and congratulations for the very interesting analysis,
   Gregorio
