\comment{AB: I am sorry, but I had no time to write this section. Please write a first draft. I have read in the last week several papers
about extracting information on the nature of dark objects and gravity in the strong-field regime combining LIGO/Virgo and also
EHT. I wanted to refer to them --- for example Maggio et al., Volkel et al., Franciolini et al., Cano et al.
It is also good if we cite papers that have predicted QNMs in gravity theories alternative to GR. We did it in the paper with
Richard and Vivien.}
