\comment{AB: I am sorry, but I had no time to write this section. Please write a first draft. I have read in the last week several papers
about extracting information on the nature of dark objects and gravity in the strong-field regime combining LIGO/Virgo and also
EHT. I wanted to refer to them --- for example Maggio et al., Volkel et al., Franciolini et al., Cano et al.
It is also good if we cite papers that have predicted QNMs in gravity theories alternative to GR. We did it in the paper with
Richard and Vivien.}

\rb{Work in progress}
We extended previous work by building a parameterized IMR waveform model that can be used to measure the QNM complex frequencies of the remnant object formed in BBH mergers with (aligned-)spinning components.

This model had been previously used to analyze BBHs from the GWTC-2~\cite{Abbott:2020jks}. Here, we extended those results by also analyzing GW events from the first and second LIGO-Virgo observing runs. Our results are the strongest constraints on the frequency and damping time of least-damped QNM obtained so far. 

These constraints could in principle be used to constrain specific non-GR theories and exotic compact objects.
\rb{this is taken from \paperone, needs to be updated:}QNM frequencies of spherically symmetric solutions were computed in theories such as Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton~\cite{Ferrari:2000ep}, dynamical Chern-Simons gravity~\cite{Molina:2010fb}, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity~\cite{Pani:2009wy,Blazquez-Salcedo:2016enn,Blazquez-Salcedo:2017txk} and for some solutions in massive (bi)gravity~\cite{Brito:2013wya,Brito:2013yxa,Babichev:2015zub}. On
the other hand, not much progress has been made to compute QNMs for
spinning BHs in alternative theories to GR, the only exception
being the Kerr-Newman case in Einstein-Maxwell
theory~\cite{Pani:2013ija,Pani:2013wsa,Mark:2014aja,Dias:2015wqa}. Most
of the estimates for QNMs of spinning BHs in modified gravity have
instead used the connection between the light ring and
QNMs~\cite{Blazquez-Salcedo:2016enn,Glampedakis:2017dvb,Jai-akson:2017ldo,Glampedakis:2017cgd},
which is formally only valid in the eikonal $\ell \to \infty$ limit
and known to fail to describe some families of QNMs when additional
degrees of freedom are present~\cite{Blazquez-Salcedo:2016enn}. 

This work can be improved in several fronts... It could be easily extended to generic precessing waveforms. Interesting future studies include using this model using waveforms obtained in recent numerical relativity simulations of non-GR theories.
