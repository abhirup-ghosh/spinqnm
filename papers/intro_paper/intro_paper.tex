The LIGO Scientific Collaboration~\citep{lsc} and the Virgo Collaborations~\citep{Virgo} recently announced their catalogue of gravitational wave observations~\citep{GWTC-2} from the first half of their third observing run~\citep{O3reference}. Combined with the confirmed observations from the first and second observing runs~\citep{abbott2019gwtc}, the Advanced LIGO detectors at Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana~\citep{aasi2015characterization}, and the Advanced Virgo detector in Cascina, Italy~\citep{acernese2014advanced} have now detected more than $40$ gravitational wave events from the merger of compact objects like neutron stars and/or black holes (compact binary coalescences/CBCs). Alongside independent claims of detections~\citep{nitz20191,nitz20202,2019PhRvD.100b3007Z,2020PhRvD.101h3030V,Venumadhav_2020}, this has firmly established the field of gravitational wave astronomy, five years on from the first ever direct detection of gravitational waves on Earth, on September 14, 2015~\citep{abbott2016observation}. 
\par
Observation of gravitational waves have had significant astrophysical and cosmological implications~\citep{LSC_2016astroph,gw170817_mma,gw170817_joint,gw170817_hubble}. It has also allowed us to make statements in fundamental physics. Specifically, LIGO-Virgo's observations have allowed us to test predictions of Einstein's theory of General Relativity~\citep[GR]{}, in previously unexplored regimes of highly relativistic, strong-field regimes of gravity~\citep{LSC_2016grtests,GW170817_TGR,gwtc1_tgr}. In GR, a CBC involving two black holes (a binary black hole/BBH system) is described in three distinct phases: an early \textit{inspiral}, where the two compact objects spiral in and \textit{plunge} due to a back-reaction of gravitational-wave-emission, a \textit{merger} event marked by the formation of an apparent horizon~\citep{NRpaper}, and a late-time \textit{ringdown}, where the newly formed remnant object settles down to a stable Kerr state through the emission of an exponentially damped quasi-normal-mode (QNM) spectrum of gravitational radiation~\citep{vishu,earlyqnmpapers}.  We have performed tests of gravitational wave generation and source dynamics, where we place bounds on parametrised deviations in the Post-Newtonian coefficients describing the early inspiral~\citep{earlydevelopmentpapers}, and phenomenological coefficients describing the intermediate (plunge) and merger regimes of coalescence~\citep{TIGERmethodspapers}, tests of gravitational wave propagation, which assume a generalised dispersion relation and place upper bounds on the Compton wavelength and consequently, the mass of the graviton~\citep{gw170104,samajdar2017projected} and tests of the polarisation of gravitational radiation using a multi-gravitational-wave-detector network~\citep{gw170814,isi2017probing}. We have also checked for consistency between different portions of the signal using estimates of final mass and spin~\citep{Ghosh:2016xx,Ghosh:2017gfp,LSC_2016grtests}, and consistency of the residuals with interferometric noise~\citep{Ghonge:2020suv,gwtc1_tgr}. None of these tests report any departure from the predictions of GR.
\par
Tests of black hole ringdown and nature of the remnant object is an active field of research at the moment. The no-hair conjecture in GR~\citep{} states that an (electrically neutral) astrophysical black hole is completely described by two observables: mass and spin angular momentum. One consequence of the no-hair conjecture is that the (complex) QNM frequencies of gravitational radiation emitted by a perturbed isolated black hole is uniquely determined by its mass and spin angular momentum. Hence a test of the no-hair conjecture would involve checking for consistency between estimates of mass and spin of the remnant object across multiple QNM frequencies. An inconsistency would either indicate a non-black hole nature of the remnant object, or an incompleteness of GR as a theory of gravity. The consistency between the post-merger signal and the least dampled QNM was first demonstrated in ~\citep{LSC_2016grtests}, and later extended to include overtones in~\citep{Giesler:2019uxc,Isi:2019aib,Bhagwat:2019dtm,Forteza:2020hbw}. Consistency of the late-time signal with a single QNM is a test of the ringdown of a BBH coalescence, but not necessarily a test of the no-hair conjecture, which requires the measurement of (atleast) two QNMs (black hole spectroscopy), and checking for consistency between them. Recent work in that direction include~\citep{Carullo:2018gah,Carullo:2019flw,Bhagwat:2019bwv}. The nature of the remnant object has also been explored through tests of black hole thermodynamics, like the Hawking's area theorem~\citep{Cabero:2017avf} or through search for echos in the post-merger signal~\citep{Nielsen:2018lkf,Tsang:2019zra,Lo:2018sep,Abedi:2018npz,Abedi:2020sgg,Testa:2018bzd}. None of these tests have found evidence for non-black hole nature of the remnant object (as described in GR) in LIGO-Virgo BBH observations.
\par
Most of the tests mentioned above focus on analysing the post-merger or late-time ringdown signal in isolation. Second generation ground-based interferometric detectors like Advanced LIGO and Virgo are most sensitive to stellar-mass black hole binaries that merge near the minima of their sensitivity band ($\sim 100$Hz). As a consequence, the remnant object \textit{rings down} in shot-noise dominated higher frequencies, leaving very little signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the post-merger signal. Furthermore, the post-merger signal of a BBH coalescence transitions from a non-linear to a linear regime where the description of the signal as a QNM spectrum becomes appropriate~\citep{}. The ringdown start time isn't a clearly defined quantity and has been explored in detail in~\citep{Bhagwat:2017tkm}. In other works~\citep{Carullo:2018gah,Carullo:2019flw}, it has been left as a free parameter to be estimated directly from the data. Uncertainties in estimates of the ringdown start-time, as well as an overall lack of SNR in the post-merger signal, given typical sensitivities of ground-based detectors result in significant statistical uncertainties in the measurement of the QNM frequencies.
\par
An independent approach to black hole spectroscopy, based on a full-signal analysis, was outlined in~\citep{Brito:2018rfr} (henceforth referred to as \paperone). \abhi{describe underlying GR model; parameterisation; advantages over other methods; highlight spin} 



Unlike methods that focus on the post-merger signal, it describes a framework in which a complete inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) waveform model is used to measure the complex QNM frequencies. \abhi{It is a spinning multipolar effective-one-body waveform calibrated to numerical relativity simulations (SEOBNRv4HM~\citep{cotesta}})This allows access to the full SNR of the signal, reducing measurement uncertainties. Moreover, the definition of the ringdown start time is built into the model and does not need to be either left as an additional free parameter or fixed using alternate definitions. While \paperone presented the method in the context of a non-spinning waveform model, we extend the analysis to the case with black holes spins in the current paper. All astrophysical black holes are expected to be spinning, and ignoring effects of spin have been shown to introduce systematic biases in the measurement of the source properties.
\par
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:model} describes our parametrised IMR waveform model. In section~\ref{sec:method}, we define our testing GR framework in which we use that model to measure the complex QNM frequencies in a Bayesian formalism. Then in section~\ref{sec:results}, we demonstrate our method on real gravitational wave events, as well as simulated signals. Finally we provide a summary of our results and discuss future developments in section  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:model} describes our waveform model, which is then used to perform our test of black hole ringdown using Bayesian framwork, outlined in section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\section{Waveform Model}\label{sec:model}

\abhi{Summary of the section:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{a description of the SEOBNRv4HM model and it's generalisation to form the pSEOBNRv4HM model}
\item{highlight the importance of spins in the model, especially with regards to the non-spinning method outlined in Brito et al.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Method/Bayesian PE}\label{sec:method}

\abhi{This section will basically provide an overview of Bayesian inference. Starting from the generalised definition of likelihood, provide an expression for the posterior on the delta QNM parameters.}

Each interferometric GW detector $I$ detects a linear combination of the two polarizations $h_+$ and $h_\times$, given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
h^I(t) & = \frac{1}{d_L} \, \left [ F^I_+(\alpha, \delta, \psi) \, h_+(t-t_0; \n, \blambda) \right. \\ 
       & \left. + F^I_{\times}(\alpha, \delta, \psi)\, h_\times(t-t_0; \n, \blambda) \right]
\label{eq:det_response}
\end{eqnarray}
where ${d_L}$ is the luminosity distance to the source, $F^I_+$ and $F^I_\times$ are the antenna pattern functions of the detector $I$, $t_0$ is the time of arrival of the signal at the detector, and $(\alpha, \delta), \psi$ define the sky position and polarisation angle of the GW source, respectively. Above, we have neglected the time dependence of the antenna pattern functions, which is a good assumption for the case of the transient signals that we consider in this work. 

The noise $n(t)$ in a GW detector can be safely described, over sufficiently short time intervals, as a stationary and Gaussian random process with zero mean and a power spectral density (PSD), $S_n(f)$. In the presence of a GW signal $h(t; \btheta)$ from a binary black hole merger described by a parameter set $\btheta$ (which include the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the binary as well as the set of parameters describing deviations from GR), we assume that the detector data $d(t)$ is the sum of the noise and the signal, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
d(t) = n(t) + h(t; \btheta). 
\end{equation}
A (quasi-circular) non-spinning binary black hole coalescence can be completely described by a 11-dimensional parameter set $\btheta = \{ \blambda, \bxi\}$ in GR, where $\blambda = \{ M_c, q, s_{1z}, s_{2z} \}$ is the set of intrinsic parameters consisting of the chirp mass $M_c$ and the asymmetric mass ratio $q = m_2/m_1$ (with the convention $m_2 \leq m_1$) and the aligned spin components $(s_{1z}, s_{2z})$, and $\bxi = \{ d_L, \alpha, \delta, \iota, \psi, t_0, \phi_0 \}$, is the set of extrinsic parameters consisting of the luminosity distance $d_L$, the sky position $\{\alpha, \delta\}$ and orientation $\{\psi, \iota\}$ of the binary, and the time and phase at coalescence $\{t_0, \phi_0\}$ respectively.

We use the Bayesian framework to obtain the posterior probability distribution $P({\btheta} \, | \, d)$ of the parameter set $\btheta$, through the Bayes Theorem:
\begin{equation}
P({\btheta} \, | \, d) = \frac{P({\btheta}) \, P (d \, | \, {\btheta})}{P(d)}.
\label{eq:Bayes_theorem}
\end{equation} 
where, $P({\btheta})$ denotes the prior probability distribution of the parameters, and $P (d \, | \, {\btheta})$ is the likelihood function, the probability of observing data $d(t)$ given the model parameters $\btheta$. $P(d)$ is a normalization constant, called the marginal likelihood: $P(d) = \int p(d|\btheta) \, p(\btheta) \, d\btheta$. Under the assumption of the data mentioned above, the likelihood function $P(d \, | \, {\btheta})$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
P (d \, | \, {\btheta}) \propto \exp \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \langle d - h({\btheta}), d - h({\btheta}) \rangle \right],
\end{equation}
where $\langle a, b \rangle$ describes the noise-weighted inner product defined as:
\begin{equation}
\langle a, b \rangle := 4 \Re \int_{f_\mathrm{low}}^{f_\mathrm{high}} \frac{\tilde{a}(f) \, \tilde{b}^*(f)}{S_n(f)}df
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{a}(f)$ denotes the Fourier transforms of $a(t)$, and the integration limits are defined by the sensitivity bandwidth of the detector, $f_\mathrm{low}$ and $f_\mathrm{high}$.

Assuming that the noise between any two detectors is uncorrelated, the joint likelihood across the three detectors is written as a product of the likelihoods in each detector:
\begin{equation}
P (d \, | \, {\btheta}) = \prod_{I \epsilon {H,L,V}} P (d^{I} \, | \, {\btheta}).
\end{equation}

In this Bayesian framework, we proceed to estimate the posterior probability distribution of $\btheta$ by stochastically sampling over the parameter space, using a python-based affine-invariant ensemble sampler \textsc{emcee}~\cite{foreman2013emcee, goodman2010ensemble}. Subsequently, we marginalize over the \textit{nuisance} parameters to obtain the posterior distributions on the non-GR parameter set, ${\Delta \blambda}$ or $c_{\ell m}$. If the data is consistent with a binary black hole signal in GR, $P(\Delta \blambda \, | \, d)$ (or $P(\Delta c_{\ell m} \, | \, d)$) is expected to be consistent with zero. 

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Priors}

\abhi{A small sub-section dedicated to priors used in this analysis. Very common question from referees.}

We assume uniform prior probability distributions on the chirp mass and mass ratio in the interval $M_c \in [1,200] M_\odot$ and $q \in [0.05,1.0]$. The prior on the location of the source is  assumed to be isotropic on the sphere of  the  sky,  with $P({d_L}) \propto d_{L}^{2}$ where $d_L \in [1,10000]$ Mpc. We use an  isotropic  prior  on  the  orientation  of  the  binary: $P({\iota,\varphi_0,\psi}) \propto \sin\iota$ with $\iota \in [0,\pi)$, $\varphi_0 \in [0,2\pi)$ and $\psi \in [0,\pi)$. For all other parameters in $\btheta$, we use uniform priors: $\alpha \in [0,2\pi)$, $\delta \in [0,2\pi)$ and $t_0 \in [-15,15]$.

\abhi{The GW150914-like injections we have:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{an SEOBNRv4HM software injection with the 22 mode frequencies estimated}
\item{a non-spinning NR injection with parameters close to the real event but higher SNR for which 22 mode frequencies are estimated}
\item{a non-spinning highly-asymmetric (q=6) NR injection with total mass similar to GW150914 and high SNR for which 22 and 33 mode frequencies are estimated}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Results on modGR injection}

\abhi{As part of review we had developed the infrastructure to make non-GR waveforms using pSEOBNRv4HM, and running LALInference on it. We had specifically chosen an injection with domega220 = dtau220  = 0.5 in zero-noise, and successfully recovered those frequencies thus demonstrating the robustness of the method in detecting deviations from GR.}

\subsection{Results on noise systematics study}

\abhi{A small summary of the noise systematics study that was done for S190521g to show that the deviations seen were consistent with systematics due to noise. The study include 2 separate sections: in Gaussian noise, and in real LIGO-Virgo noise immediately adjacent to the actual event.}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/S190521g_gaussiannoiseinjections.png}
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/S190521g_swinjs.png}
\end{figure}

We injected NRSur7dq4 signal using the MaxL parameters from EXP30, in 2.5 hours of data surrounding the event at: t0-1.5 hours, t0-1., t0-0.5, t0+0.5, t0+1. For 3 of the 5 noise realisations, corresponding to t0-1 hour, t0+0.5 hours, and t0+1.0 hour we recover a damping time similar to the actual event, whereas for a third case, t0-0.5 hours, we obtain a damping time consistent at the 90\% credible interval. L1-SNR goes down by more than 3 in some runs (maximum L1-SNR 12, minimum 9), indicative of how the noise variability is strongly affecting the recovered parameters. For some injections the mass ratio is biased, although final spin (most sensitive to mass ratio) is not affected much.  domega varies quite a lot among runs, instead dtau seems well behaved around zero. Effective frequency is a stable parameter (always well measured), while effective tau is much more sensitive to the noise configuration.
