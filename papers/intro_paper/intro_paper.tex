\begin{abstract}
  The no-hair conjecture in General Relativity states that the
  properties of an \ab{astrophysical} Kerr black hole (BH) are completely described by its
  mass and spin angular momentum. As a consequence, the complex
  quasi-normal-mode (QNM) frequencies of a binary black hole (BBH)
  ringdown can be uniquely determined by the mass and spin of the
  remnant object. Conversely, measurement of the QNM frequencies could
  be an independent test of the no-hair conjecture. This paper \ab{extends to spinning BHs earlier work} 
 \sout{outlines a} \ab{that proposed to} 
  test \sout{of} the no-hair conjecture by measuring the complex QNM
  frequencies of a BBH ringdown \sout{within the framework of, for the first
  time, a spinning} using inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform\ab{s} \sout{model}, thereby
  \sout{using} \ab{taking full advantage of} the entire signal power and removing dependency on the
  predicted or estimated start time of the proposed ringdown. We
  further demonstrate the robustness of the test against modified
  gravitational-wave (GW) signals with a ringdown different from what
  GR predicts for Kerr BHs. \ab{Our} method was used to analyse the
  properties of the merger remnants for the events observed by
  LIGO-Virgo in the first half of their third observing run (O3a) in
  the latest LIGO-Virgo publication. In this paper, for the first
  time, we analyse the GW events from the first \ab{(O1)} and second \ab{(O2)} LIGO-Virgo
  observing runs and provide joint constraints with published results
  from O3a. We also analyse two events from the O3a \ab{catalogue} \sout{list of events} 
  that were not considered \sout{for} \ab{in}  the initial \ab{LIGO-Virgo} analysis. Finally, the
  joint measurements of the fractional deviations in the frequency,
  $\df{220} = XX \pm$ and $\dtau{220} = YY \pm$ are the strongest
  constraints yet using this method. %Finally, we also present a investigation into possible systematic effects due to an incomplete understanding of the interferometric noise around the GW event on the results of this test.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\comment{AB: Please make the citations in the bibliography uniform (I would stick with citations 
taken from InSpires and remove the URL links). We will be submitting to Physical Review D, so please 
stick with American English. Also, please be uniform when writing captions, when using colors and style 
of curves in plots, when building Tables. There is not a lot of discussion in the text on the main results of the paper (Sec. IV). 
The abstract would need to be tighten and made more crispy once the quantitative results for the 
bounds are included.}

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration~\citep{lsc} and the Virgo
Collaboration\sout{s}~\citep{Virgo} \ab{have} recently announced their catalogue of
gravitational-wave (GW) \sout{observations} \ab{signals}~\citep{GWTC-2} from the first
half of the\sout{ir} third observing run (O3a)~\citep{O3reference}. Combined
with \sout{the confirmed observations from} the first and second observing-run \ab{catalogues}~\citep{abbott2019gwtc}, the Advanced LIGO detectors at Hanford,
Washington and Livingston, Louisiana~\citep{aasi2015characterization},
and the Advanced Virgo detector in Cascina,
Italy~\citep{acernese2014advanced} have now detected \sout{more than} $50$ GW
events from the merger of compact objects like neutron stars and/or
black holes (BHs).\sout{, collectively called compact binary coalescences
(CBCs).} Alongside independent claims of
detections~\citep{nitz20191,nitz20202,2019PhRvD.100b3007Z,2020PhRvD.101h3030V,Venumadhav_2020},
\sout{this} \ab{these results} \sout{has} \ab{have} firmly established the field of GW astronomy, five years \sout{on
from} \ab{after} the first \sout{ever direct} detection of a GW \ab{passing through the} \sout{on} Earth, \ab{notably GW150914} 
\sout{on September 14,2015}~\citep{abbott2016observation}.

\ab{The observation of GWs has} had significant astrophysical and cosmological
implications~\citep{LSC_2016astroph,gw170817_mma,gw170817_joint,gw170817_hubble}. It
has also allowed us to \sout{make statements in} \ab{probe} fundamental
physics \sout{.Specifically, LIGO-Virgo's observations have allowed us to} and 
test predictions of Einstein's theory of General Relativity 
(GR)~\citep{GR} in the previously unexplored \ab{highly-dynamical, and strong field 
regime} \sout{of highly relativistic, strong-field regimes of
gravity}~\citep{LSC_2016grtests,GW170817_TGR,gwtc1_tgr}. In GR\sout{, a CBC
involving two BHs (}a binary black hole (BBH) system\sout{)} is described \sout{in} \ab{by}
three \sout{distinct} phases: an early \textit{inspiral}, where the two
compact objects spiral in \ab{loosing energy because of the emission of GWs} \sout{and \textit{plunge} due to a back-reaction
of GW-emission}, a \textit{merger} marked by the
formation of a\sout{n} \ab{common} apparent horizon~\citep{NRpaper}, and a \sout{late-time} 
\textit{ringdown}, \sout{where} \ab{during which} the newly formed remnant object settles down
to a \sout{stable} Kerr \ab{BH} \sout{state through the emission of} \ab{emitting} \sout{an exponentially damped} 
quasi-normal-modes (QNMs) \sout{spectrum of gravitational
radiation}~\citep{vishu,earlyqnmpapers} \ab{(i.e., damped oscillations with specific, discrete 
frequencies and decay times)}.

The LIGO-Virgo collaborations \ab{have released companion papers \cite{}} detailing their \sout{latest} results 
of tests of GR  \sout{using events} \ab{for GW150914} \cite{} and \ab{for several GW events of} 
the \sout{first} two transient catalogues (TC): GWTC-1\cite{}  and GWTC-2 \cite{}. 
The results include tests of GW generation and source dynamics, where bounds are placed on
parameterized deviations in the post-Newtonian \ab{(PN)} coefficients describing
the early inspiral~\citep{earlydevelopmentpapers}, and
phenomenological coefficients describing the intermediate (plunge) and
merger regimes of coalescence~\citep{TIGERmethodspapers}; tests of GW
propagation, which assume a generalized dispersion relation and place
upper bounds on the Compton wavelength and, consequently, the mass of
the graviton~\citep{gw170104,samajdar2017projected}, and tests of the
polarization of gravitational radiation using a
multi--GW-detector network~\citep{gw170814,isi2017probing}. The \ab{GWTC-1/2} paper\ab{s} also 
check\sout{s} for consistency between different portions of the signal using estimates
\sout{of} \ab{for the} predicted mass and spin of the remnant
object~\citep{Ghosh:2016xx,Ghosh:2017gfp,LSC_2016grtests}, and
consistency of the residuals with interferometric
noise~\citep{Ghonge:2020suv,gwtc1_tgr}. None of these tests report any
departure from the predictions of GR.

\ab{The first paper on tests of GR by the LIGO Collaboration~\cite{} provided us with the 
first measurement of the dominant damped-oscillation signal in the ringdown stage of a BBH 
coalescence.} The LIGO-Virgo O3a testing GR paper~\cite{} \ab{has recently reported} 
\sout{also details results on tests} \ab{a comprehensive analysis of the properties of the 
remnant object, including the ringdown stage, for tens of GW events.}   
\sout{BH ringdown and nature of the remnant object, which is an active field
of research at the moment.} The no-hair conjecture in GR~\citep{}
states that an (electrically neutral) astrophysical BH is completely
described by two observables: mass and spin angular momentum. One
consequence of the no-hair conjecture is that the (complex) QNM
frequencies of gravitational radiation emitted by a perturbed isolated
BH \ab{are} \sout{is} uniquely determined by its mass and spin angular momentum. Hence
a test of the no-hair conjecture would involve checking for
consistency between estimates of mass and spin of the remnant object
across multiple QNM frequencies~\cite{Dreyer:2003bv}. An inconsistency would either
indicate a non-BH nature of the remnant object, or an incompleteness
of GR as the underlying theory of gravity. 

The consistency between the post-merger signal and the least damped QNM was first demonstrated in 
Ref.~\citep{LSC_2016grtests} for GW150914, and later extended to include
overtones in Refs.~\citep{Brito:2018rfr,Giesler:2019uxc,Isi:2019aib,Bhagwat:2019dtm,Forteza:2020hbw}. Consistency
of the late-time \sout{signal} \ab{waveform} with a single QNM is a test of the ringdown of
a BBH coalescence, but not necessarily a test of the no-hair
conjecture, which requires the measurement of (at least) two QNMs (BH
spectroscopy), and \sout{checking for} consistency between them~\cite{Dreyer:2003bv,Berti:2005ys}. Recent work
in that direction \comment{AB: which direction? There are papers by Nikhef group and 
also Brito et al., and many others that have investigated BH spectroscopy.} include~\citep{Carullo:2018gah,Carullo:2019flw,Bhagwat:2019bwv}. The
nature of the remnant object has also been explored through tests of
BH thermodynamics, like the Hawking's area
theorem~\citep{Cabero:2017avf} or through search for echos in the
post-merger
signal~\citep{Nielsen:2018lkf,Tsang:2019zra,Lo:2018sep,Abedi:2018npz,Abedi:2020sgg,Testa:2018bzd}. None
of these tests have found evidence for non-BH nature of the remnant
object (as described in GR) in LIGO-Virgo BBH observations.

\comment{AB: I don't understand the next sentence, it looks to me out of context.} 
Most of the tests mentioned above focus on analysing the post-merger
or late-time ringdown signal in isolation. \sout{Second generation
ground-based interferometric detectors like} \ab{Ground-based detectors, 
such as \sout{Advanced} LIGO and Virgo,} are most sensitive to 
stellar-mass BH binaries that merge near the
minim\ab{um}\sout{a} of their sensitivity band ($\sim 100$Hz). As a consequence, the
remnant object \textit{rings down} \comment{AB: we are not discussing the interferometer noises, 
so why to give such a detail about the shot noise?} \sout{in shot-noise dominated higher
frequencies, leaving} \ab{at frequencies where the sensitivity is worse, leaving} 
very little signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the
post-merger signal. \comment{AB: This discussion about the starting time of the ringdown starts too abruptly, 
and looks out of context and incomplete. Also, why are we citing only those papers? The matter 
has a long history. There have been calibrations to NR of damped- oscillation signals.} 
The ringdown start time is not a clearly defined
quantity and has been explored in detail
in Ref.~\citep{Bhagwat:2017tkm}. In other
works~\citep{Carullo:2018gah,Carullo:2019flw}, it has been left as a
free parameter to be estimated directly from the data. Uncertainties
in estimates of the ringdown start-time, as well as, an overall lack of
SNR in the post-merger signal, given typical sensitivities of
ground-based detectors, result in significant statistical uncertainties
in the measurement of the QNM frequencies. 

An independent approach to BH spectroscopy, based on the full-signal
analysis, was \sout{outlined} \ab{introduced} in Ref.~\citep{Brito:2018rfr} 
(henceforth referred to as \paperone). Unlike methods that focus \ab{only} 
on the post-merger signal, it \sout{describes a framework in which a} 
\ab{employs the} complete inspiral-merger-ringdown
(IMR) waveform \sout{model is used} to measure the complex QNM
frequencies. This \sout{allows} \ab{gives} access to the full SNR of the signal,
reducing measurement uncertainties. Moreover, the definition of the
ringdown start time is built into the \ab{merger-ringdown} model and does not need to be
either left as an additional free parameter or fixed using alternate
definitions. While \paperone presented the method \ab{and tested it for }\sout{in the context of a
non-spinning waveform model} \ab{non-spinning BBHs}, \ab{here} we extend the analysis to the \ab{more 
realistic astrophysical} case in which BHs \ab{carry} spin\sout{s in the current paper}. \ab{Furthermore, 
the IMR waveform model used in this paper is more accurate than what employed in \paperone, 
because it contains higher-order corrections in PN theory and it was calibrated to a much larger set 
of numerical-relativity (NR) waveforms~\cite{Bohe:2016gbl}.}  All astrophysical BHs are expected to be spinning, 
and ignoring effects of spin has been shown to introduce systematic biases in the measurement of the 
source properties \cite{paper_showing_systematics_from_ignoring_spin}.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:model} describes our parameterized IMR
waveform model. In Sec.~\ref{sec:method}, we define our framework to test GR\ab{, notably how we can measure 
complex QNM frequencies with our parameterized model within a Bayesian formalism}. Then, in Sec.~\ref{sec:results}, 
we demonstrate our method on real GW events, as well as simulated signals. \ab{In particular, we analyze 
the ... and constrain the QNM frequecies ... Finally, in Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion} we provide a summary of
our results and discuss future developments.} 

\ab{\section{Waveform model and statistical strategy to measure quasi-normal modes}}

\comment{AB: In the following, I will not use much the strike-out, but instead I will 
bracket in color the text that I have changed.}

A GW signal from the (quasi-circular) coalescence of two BHs is
completely described in GR by a \sout{fixed set of} $15$ parameters,
$\bxigr$. These can be grouped into the \emph{intrinsic} parameters:
the masses, $m_1, m_2$ and spins, $\bs1, \bs2$ of the \ab{component 
objects in the} \sout{initial} binary; and the 
\emph{extrinsic} parameters: \ab{a reference time $t_c$ and phase 
$\phi_c$,} the sky position of the binary ($\alpha$,
$\delta$), the luminosity distance, $d_L$, and \ab{the binary's} orientation
described through the inclination of the binary $\iota$ and its
polarization $\psi$. \ab{We also introduce the total mass $M = m_1+m_2$, 
and the (dimensionless) symmetric mass ratio $\nu = m_1m_2/M^2$}. 

\ab{Here, we focus on BHs with spins aligned or anti-aligned 
with the orbital angular momentum (henceforth, ``aligned-spin''). In this case,  
the GW signal depends on $11$ parameters. We denote the 
aligned-spin \ab{(dimensionless)} components as $\chi_{i} = |\vec{\bm{S}}_i|/m^2_i$, where $i=1,2$ for the two BHs.}

\ab{\subsection{Parameterized waveform model}}\label{sec:model}

As in \paperone, we use an IMR waveform model developed within the effective-one-body (EOB) 
formalism~\cite{}. \ab{However, whereas \paperone was limited to non-spinning multipolar waveforms, 
here we use as our baseline model the aligned-spin multipolar waveform model 
developed in Ref.~\citep{Cotesta:2018fcv}}. In addition to being
calibrated to NR simulations, this model also uses information from BH
perturbation theory for the merger and ringdown phases. \sout{Therefore this
waveform model provides a very accurate and faithful semi-analytic
description of the inspiral, merger and ringdown phases.} \ab{Henceforth we
will denote this model by $\SEOB$ for short}~\footnote{\ab{In the LIGO Algorithm Library (LAL), this 
waveform model is called {\tt SEOBNRv4HM}.}}.


In the observer's frame, the GW polarizations can be written as 
%
\begin{equation}
h_+(\iota,\varphi;t ) - i h_\times(\iota,\varphi;t) = \sum_{\ell, m} {}_{-\!2}Y_{\ell m}(\iota,\varphi)\, h_{\ell m}(t)\,,
\end{equation}
%
\comment{AB: there is a mismatch of notations for the parameters with respect to what was introduced above.}
where $\varphi$ is the azimuthal direction to the observer, ${}_{-\!2}Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi)$ are the $-2$ spin-weighted spherical harmonics. The $\SEOB$ model we employ includes the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2),(2,1)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$, and $(5,5)$ modes~\cite{Cotesta:2018fcv}. For each $(\ell, m)$, the inspiral-(plunge-)merger-ringdown $\SEOB$ waveform is schematically given by
%
\begin{equation}
h_{\ell m}(t) = h_{\ell m}^\mathrm{insp-plunge}\, \theta(t_\mathrm{match}^{\ell m} - t) + h_{\ell m}^\mathrm{merger-RD}\,\theta(t-t_\mathrm{match}^{\ell m})\,,
\end{equation}
where $\theta(t)$ is the Heaviside step function, $h_{\ell m}^\mathrm{insp-plunge}$ represents the inspiral-plunge part of the waveform, whereas $h_{\ell m}^\mathrm{merger-RD}$ denotes the merger-ringdown \ab{waveform, which reads~\citep{Bohe:2016gbl,Cotesta:2018fcv}}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{RD}
h_{\ell m}^{\textrm{merger-RD}}(t) = \nu \ \tilde{A}_{\ell m}(t)\ e^{i \tilde{\phi}_{\ell m}(t)} \ e^{-i \sigma_{\ell m 0}(t-t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m})},
\end{equation}
%
where $\nu$ is the symmetric mass ratio of the binary and $\sigma_{\ell m0} = 2\pi f_{\ell m 0} -i/\tau_{\ell m 0}$ denotes the complex frequency of the fundamental QNMs of the remnant BH. We denote the oscillation frequencies by $f_{\ell m  0}\equiv \Re(\sigma_{\ell m0})/(2\pi)$ and the decay times by $\tau_{\ell m 0}\equiv -1/\Im(\sigma_{\ell m0}) $. 
The functions $\tilde{A}_{\ell m}(t)$ and $\tilde{\phi}_{\ell m}(t)$ are given by~\cite{Bohe:2016gbl,Cotesta:2018fcv}:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ansatz_amp}
\tilde{A}_{\ell m}(t) = c_{1,c}^{\ell m} \tanh[c_{1,f}^{\ell m}\ (t-t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m}) \ +\ c_{2,f}^{\ell m}] \ + \ c_{2,c}^{\ell m},
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ansatz_phase}
\tilde{\phi}_{\ell m}(t) = \phi_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m} - d_{1,c}^{\ell m} \log\left[\frac{1+d_{2,f}^{\ell m} e^{-d_{1,f}^{\ell m}(t-t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m})}}{1+d_{2,f}^{\ell m}}\right],
\end{equation}
%
where $ \phi_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m}$ is the phase of the inspiral-plunge mode $(\ell, m)$ computed at $t = t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m}$. The coefficients $d_{1,c}^{\ell m}$ and $c_{i,c}^{\ell m}$ with $i = 1,2$
are fixed by imposing that the functions $\tilde{A}_{\ell m}(t)$ and $\tilde{\phi}_{\ell m}(t)$ are of class $C^1$ at $t = t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m}$, when matching the merger-ringdown waveform to the inspiral-plunge $\SEOB$ waveform $h_{\ell m}^\mathrm{inspiral-plunge}(t)$. This allows us to write the coefficients $c_{i,c}^{\ell m}$ as~\cite{Cotesta:2018fcv}:
% in terms of $c_{1,f}^{\ell   m},\ c_{2,f}^{\ell m},\ \sigma^\textrm{R}_{\ell m},\ |h_{\ell    m}^{\textrm{insp-plunge}}(t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell  m})|,\ \partial_t|h_{\ell    m}^{\textrm{insp-plunge}}(t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m})|$ as
\begin{align} 
\label{c1}
c_{1,c}^{\ell m} &= \frac{1}{c_{1,f}^{\ell
    m} \nu} \big[ \partial_t|h_{\ell
    m}^{\textrm{insp-plunge}}(t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m})| \nonumber \\
    &- \sigma^\textrm{R}_{\ell m} |h_{\ell
    m}^{\textrm{insp-plunge}}(t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell
    m})|\big] \cosh^2{(c_{2,f}^{\ell m})}, \\
\label{c2}
c_{2,c}^{\ell m} &= -\frac{ |h_{\ell
    m}^{\textrm{insp-plunge}}(t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell
    m})|}{\nu} + \frac{1}{c_{1,f}^{\ell
    m} \nu} \big[ \partial_t|h_{\ell
    m}^{\textrm{insp-plunge}}(t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m})|  \nonumber \\
    &- \sigma^\textrm{R}_{\ell m} |h_{\ell
    m}^{\textrm{insp-plunge}}(t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell
    m})|\big] \cosh{(c_{2,f}^{\ell m})}\sinh{(c_{2,f}^{\ell m})}, \\ \nonumber   
\end{align}
and $d_{1,c}^{\ell m}$ as
\begin{align}
\label{d1}    
d_{1,c}^{\ell m} &= \left[\omega_{\ell m}^{\textrm{insp-plunge}}(t_{\textrm{match}}^{\ell m}) -  \sigma^\textrm{I}_{\ell
      m}\right]\frac{1+ d_{2,f}^{\ell m}}{d_{1,f}^{\ell m}d_{2,f}^{\ell m}}\,,
\end{align}
%
where we denoted $\sigma_{\ell m}^\textrm{R} \equiv \Im (\sigma_{\ell m0}) < 0$ and  $\sigma_{\ell m}^\textrm{I} \equiv -\Re (\sigma_{\ell m0})$, and $\omega_{\ell m}^{\textrm{insp-plunge}}(t)$ is the frequency of the inspiral-plunge EOB mode. The coefficients $c_{i,f}^{\ell m}$ and $d_{i,f}^{\ell m}$ are obtained through fits to NR and 
Teukolsky-equation--based waveforms and can be found in Appendix C of Ref.~\cite{Cotesta:2018fcv}.

In the $\SEOB$ model constructed in Ref.~\cite{Cotesta:2018fcv}, the
complex frequencies $\sigma_{\ell m 0}$ are expressed in terms of the
final BH mass and spin~\cite{Berti:2005ys,Berti:2009kk}, and the
latter are related to the BBH's component masses and spins through
NR--fitting-formulas obtained in
GR~\cite{Taracchini:2013rva,Hofmann:2016yih}. Here instead, in the
spirit of what was done in \paperone, we promote the QNM (complex)
frequencies to be free parameters of the model, while keeping the
inspiral-plunge modes $h_{\ell m}^\mathrm{inspiral-plunge}(t)$ fixed
to their GR values. \ab{More explicitly, we introduce a parameterized 
version of the $\SEOB$ model where the frequency and the
damping time of the ${\ell m 0}$ mode (i.e, $(f_{\ell m 0}, \tau
_{\ell m 0})$) is defined through the fractional deviations, $(\delta
f_{\ell m 0},\delta \tau_{\ell m 0})$, from the corresponding GR
values, which are obtained using NR fits~\cite{Taracchini:2013rva,Hofmann:2016yih}. Thus,} 
\begin{eqnarray}
f_{\ell m 0} &=& f_{\ell m 0}^{\text{GR}}\, (1 + \delta f_{\ell m 0})\,,\label{eq:nongr_freqs_a} \\ 
\tau _{\ell m 0} &=& \tau _{\ell m 0}^{\text{GR}}\, (1 + \delta \tau_{\ell m 0})\,. \label{eq:nongr_freqs_b}
\end{eqnarray}
\ab{We denote such a parameterized waveform model $\pSEOB$}~\footnote{\ab{This 
waveform model is called {\tt pSEOBNRv4HM} in LAL.}}.

\ab{As said}, the GR quantities $( f_{\ell m 0}^{GR},\tau_{\ell m 0}^{GR})$ are
constructed using the same NR--fitting--formula \sout{prescriptiion} 
described above. We note that when leaving $\sigma_{\ell m}$ to vary
freely, the functions $\tilde{A}_{\ell m}(t)$ and $\tilde{\phi}_{\ell
  m}(t)$ \sout{will} in general also differ from the GR prediction\ab{s}, since
those functions depend on the QNM complex frequencies, as can be seen
from the expressions for $c_{i,c}^{\ell m}$ and $d_{1,c}^{\ell m}$ \ab{in Eqs.~(\ref{c1}), 
(\ref{c2}), and (\ref{d1}).}


\ab{\subsection{Bayesian parameter-estimation technique}}
\label{sec:method}

The parameterized model, $\pSEOB$, described above introduces an additional set of non-GR parameters, $\bxingr = (\delta f_{\ell m 0},\delta \tau_{\ell m 0})$, corresponding to each $(\ell,m)$ QNM present in the GR waveform model $\SEOB$. One then proceeds to use the Bayes theorem to obtain the \emph{posterior} probability distribution on $\blambda = \{\bxigr, \bxingr\}$, given a hypothesis $\mathcal{H}$:
%
\begin{equation}
P(\blambda | d, \mathcal{H}) = \frac{P(\blambda | \mathcal{H}) \, \mathcal{L}(d | \blambda, \mathcal{H})}{P(d|\mathcal{H})},
\label{eq:Bayes_theorem}
\end{equation}
%
where $P(\blambda | \mathcal{H})$ is the \emph{prior} probability distribution, and $\mathcal{L}(d | \blambda, \mathcal{H})$ is called the \emph{likelihood} function. The denominator is a normalization constant $P(d|\mathcal{H}) = \int P(\blambda | \mathcal{H}) \, \mathcal{L}(d | \blambda, \mathcal{H}) \, d\blambda$, called the marginal likelihood, or the \emph{evidence} of the hypothesis $\mathcal{H}$. In this case, our hypothesis $\mathcal{H}$ is that the data contains a GW signal that is described by the $\pSEOB$ waveform model $h(\blambda)$  and stationary Gaussian noise described by a power spectral density (PSD) $S_n(f)$. The likelihood function can consequently be defined as:
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(d | \blambda, \mathcal{H}) \propto \exp\big[-\frac{1}{2} \langle d - h(\blambda) \, | \, d -h(\blambda) \rangle \big],
\label{eq:likelihood}
\end{equation}
%
where $\langle . | . \rangle$ is the following noise-weighted inner product:
%
\begin{equation}
\langle A | B \rangle = \int_{f_\mathrm{low}} ^{f_\mathrm{high}} df \frac{\tilde{A}^*(f)\tilde{B}(f) + \tilde{A}(f)\tilde{B}^*(f)}{S_n(f)}.
\label{eq:nwip}
\end{equation}
%
\ab{The quantity} $\tilde{A}(f)$ denotes the Fourier transform of $A(t)$ and the $^*$ indicates complex conjugation. The limits of integration ${f_\mathrm{low}}$ and ${f_\mathrm{high}}$ define the bandwidth of the sensitivity of the GW detector. We usually assume ${f_\mathrm{high}}$ to be the Nyquist frequency whereas${f_\mathrm{low}}$ is dictated by \ab{the performance of the 
GW detector at low-frequency and we assume XXX}. \comment{AB: It isn't just seismic noise. In fact, at low frequency, there are mysterious noises that people have had hard time 
to control.} \sout{the response of the gravitational detector to low-frequency seismic noise.} Owing to the large dimensionality of the parameter set $\blambda$, the posterior distribution $P(\blambda | d, \mathcal{H})$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Bayes_theorem}) is computed by stochastically sampling the parameter space using techniques such as Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)~\cite{} or Nested Sampling~\cite{}. For this paper, we use the \verb+LALInference+~\cite{} and \verb+Bilby+ codes~\cite{} that provide an implementation of the parallely tempered MCMC and Nested Sampling algorithms respectively, for computing the posterior distributions. 

Given the full-dimensional posterior probability density function $P(\blambda | d, \mathcal{H})$, we can marginalize over the \emph{nuisance} parameters, to obtain the marginalized posterior probability density function over the QNM parameters $\bxingr$:

\begin{equation}
P(\bxingr | d, \mathcal{H})= \int P(\blambda | d, \mathcal{H}) d\bxigr\,.
\end{equation}

For most of the results discussed in this paper, we restrict ourselves
to the $(\ell m) = (2,2)$ and/or $(3,3)$ modes. In those cases we
\sout{would} assume $\bxingr = \{\df{220},\dtau{220}\}$ and/or $
\{\df{330},\dtau{330}\}$, and all the other $(\ell m)$ modes to be
fixed at their GR predictions (i.e., $\delta f_{\ell m 0} = \delta
\tau_{\ell m 0} = 0$). This is because, for most of the high-mass BH 
events that we find most appropriate for this test, the LIGO-Virgo
observations are consistent with nearly--equal-mass face-on/off BBHs 
for which power in the subdominant modes is not enough to
attempt to measure more than one, or at most \comment{AB: it seems some wrods are missing 
to make the senetence meaningful} QNM frequencies, 
simultaneously.

\ab{Lastly}, throughout our analysis, we assume uniform priors on our non-GR QNM
parameters, $(\delta f_{\ell m 0},\delta \tau_{\ell m 0})$. However,
since the priors on $( f_{\ell m 0}^{GR},\tau_{\ell m 0}^{GR})$ are
derived through NR--fits, from the corresponding priors on the initial
masses and spins, this leads to a non-trivial prior on the final
reconstructed frequency and damping time, $( f_{\ell m 0},\tau_{\ell m
  0})$. Also, given the definition of the damping time in
Sec.~\ref{sec:model}, we \sout{realize} \ab{note} that $\delta \tau_{\ell m 0} = -1$ leads
to the imaginary part of the frequency going to infinity. We avoid
this by restricting the minimum of the prior on $\delta \tau_{\ell m
  0}$ to be greater than $-1$.

\iffalse
\subsection{Priors}

Throughout our analysis we assume a completely prior uniform in the component masses $m_1, m_2$. Our prior on the spins are uniform in the magnitude between (0,1) and isotropic in spin orientation, but finally restricted to the component parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the binary. The prior on the distance varies as $d_L^2$ giving more weightage to binaries farther out. For the rest of the parameters we use standard priors as defined in the documentation (CITE Vietch et al. 2015 LALInference paper). For our non-GR ringdown parameters, we assume uniform priors. This of course leads to a non-trivial prior on the reconstructed frequency and damping time, because of the prior on $( f_{\ell m 0}^{GR},\tau_{\ell m 0}^{GR})$, which itself depend on the prior on the initial masses and spins through NR fits \abhi{perhaps figure on priors on QNM quantities}. For $d\tau = -1$, we encounter a singularity (the imaginary part of the frequency goes to infinity), which we avoid by restricting the minimum of the prior on $d\tau$ to be greater than $-1$.

\ab{To avoid possible systematic biases in our parameter-estimation analysis 
due to error in waveform modeling,} we use the GR version of the same waveform,
$\SEOB$ (without allowing for deviations in the QNM parameters) to
simulate our GW signal. And to avoid systematic biases due to noise,
we use an averaged (zero-noise) realization of the noise. A detailed
study on noise systematics for one of the GW events is presented in
Appendix~\ref{sec:noise_systematics}. \comment{AB: This reference to the Appendix is out of context. 
Why should the reader appreciate at this stage of the paper, where we have not yet 
discussed results with real data, what is in the Appendix?} As in the case of the actual
detections, we consider a two-detector LIGO network at
Hanford and Livingston, having identical PSDs. The distance to the two
\ab{synthetic} events is rescaled such that the SNR in the detector network
is the same as the actual events (i.e., 24 for GW150914 and 14 
for GW190521). Since mearly--equal-mass binaries like GW150914 and
GW190521 observed at moderately high SNRs are not expected to have a
loud ringdown signal, we restrict ourselves to estimating the
frequency and damping time of \ab{only one QNM} $(\ell m) = (2,2)$, i.e.,
$\{\df{220},\dtau{220}\}$, while fixing the other QNM frequencies to
their GR values.

We find, as one might expect, that the posterior distribution on the
parameters describing fractional deviations in the frequency and
damping time are consistent with zero (left panels of
Fig.~\ref{fig:simulated_signal_GR}). One can then convert these
fractional quantities into absolute quantities using the relations
given in Eqs.~\ref{eq:nongr_freqs_a} and ~\ref{eq:nongr_freqs_b}, and
construct posterior distributions on these effective quantities,
$(\fngr{220}, \taungr{220})$ (right panels of
Fig.~\ref{fig:simulated_signal_GR}). In each of these cases, the recovered
\ab{2D} posterior{\ab{s} are consistent with the GR predictions 
(black \sout{solid lines} \ab{dot}). \comment{AB: please be precise in referring 
to 1D and 2D posteriors when discussing the figures.}}


\subsection{\ab{Simulations using non-GR signals in Gaussian noise}} \label{ssec:ngr_signal}


To demonstrate the robustness of the method in detecting possible
deviations \sout{of the underlying GW signal from predictions of} \ab{from GR}, 
we inject \sout{simulated} \ab{synthetic} GW signals which are identical to 
the corresponding GR prediction up to merger, and differ in their post-merger
description. We again choose \sout{systems with initial-}binary-parameters
similar to GW150914 and GW190521 (as given in Table XXX), but 
\sout{we attach a phenomenological post-merger signal described by deviation parameters} 
\ab{set} $\df{220} = \dtau{220} = 0.5$ \comment{AG: deviations=0.1 runs are ongoing and almost
  done. AB: I would show results that include the $10\%$ case, which is more realistic, 
based on QNM predictions in theories of gravity alternative to GR.}. 
In other words, we assume that the frequency and damping time
of our non-GR signal is 1.5 times the corresponding GR prediction,
although the pre-merger signal is identical to GR. \ab{In Fig.~\ref{fig:nongr_waveform} 
we show ...}  \comment{AB: Not clear to me what the next sentence says. Coudl 
you just clearly refer to thePlease introduce the injected signal and the template, which is used 
to recover it, and simply say that they belong to the same waweform model.} 
We also avoid waveform \sout{and noise} systematic biases by choosing 
a configuration identical to the simulations described in Sec.\ref{ssec:gr_signal}. \ab{We 
summarize the results of the Bayesian analysis in Fig.~\ref{fig:simulated_signal_nonGR} where we 
show the posterior probability distributions for $(\df{220}, \dtau{220})$, or equivalently
$(\fngr{220}, \taungr{220})$. We find that they are consistent with the corresponding 
values of the injection parameters, indicated by the black solid lines.} \comment{AB: Please be more quantitative when 
explaining the results in the figure. Which black lines are you referring to? In the main 2-D figure the injected signal 
is a point not a line. I think you are referring to the 1D posteriors, but it needs to be explained.}

We additionally investigate the effects of erroneously assuming that
\sout{an underlying modified} \ab{a non-GR} signal can be well-described 
\ab{by a GR one}. We do this by estimating the parameters of our \ab{non-GR} 
signals using the GR waveform model $\SEOB$ instead of the parameterized 
$\pSEOB$. \comment{AB: Not clear what the next senetnce wants to say.} 
In such cases, we run the risk of biased parameter estimates due to an
incomplete understanding of the underlying signal. The resulting
posterior probability distributions are shown in the right panels of
Fig.~\ref{fig:simulated_signal_nonGR} by the \ab{red (GW150914-like) and blue 
(GW190521-like) curves.} The results are interesting and distinctly
different for the two events. For the GW150914-like \comment{AB: I would avoid using 
``modified'' GR, but istsead non-GR.} \ab{non-GR} signal, the measurements of $(\fgr{220}, \taugr{220})$
(see top right panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:simulated_signal_nonGR}) are consistent
with the $(\fgr{220}, \taugr{220})$ measurements for a signal with no
deviations from GR (see top right panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:simulated_signal_GR}). In other
words, if the actual signal had deviations \ab{from GR} as large as the $50\%$ \sout{of
the GR prediction}, the analysis with \ab{the GR signal} $\SEOB$ would likely have
reported \emph{no} deviation from the GR prediction. However in the
case of the GW190521-like \ab{non-GR} signal, a simple GR analysis of
the non-GR signal would have yielded measurements distinctly
different from either of the two parameterized estimates: with and
without deviations. \comment{AB: Not clear to me the next sentence. We are working 
in Gaussian noise, so why are you referring to the noise as the culprit or the 
source of difference?} The fact that the GW190521-like signal has a much
lower SNR than GW150914-like signal might be a possible reason for the 
measurement of the final quantities to be more susceptible to noise. A
more detailed comparison of the other parameters, like the masses and
spins, between an $\pSEOB$ and an $\SEOB$ measurement of a modified GR
signal is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gr_ngr_comparison}. \comment{AB: Please 
comment the figures. What are the main results? What do we deduce?}

\subsection{Test of the no-hair conjecture}\label{ssec:nohairtheorem}

Finally, we provide a simple demonstration of a test of the no-hair
theorem using our model. As described in the introduction, any test of
the no-hair theorem of BHs would need to involve independent
measurements of (at least) two different QNMs. 

\ab{Here, we} use a \sout{simulated} NR GW signal from the SXS catalog~\cite{} 
corresponding to a non-spinning BBH with mass-ratio $q=6$ (SXS:BBH:0166), 
\sout{rescaled to a} total mass $M=84 \Mo$ (see Table~\ref{tab:injection_values}). 
We choose an asymmetric system to increase the SNR in the higher modes. 
We also \sout{rescale} \ab{choose} the distance and orientation of the binary 
such that the total SNR \sout{of the signal} in \sout{a} \ab{the} network of 
the three detectors, LIGO Hanford, Livingston and
Virgo, is 75. Based on the LIGO-Virgo observations during O3a, such
asymmetric and loud signals are no longer just a theoretical
prediction, but quite plausible at design sensitivities. Using this
signal, we attempt to measure \ab{both} the \sout{QNM frequencies} $(2,\pm 2)$ and
$(3,\pm 3)$ \sout{modes} \ab{QNMs} \sout{together}. \ab{We summarize 
our results in Fig.~\ref{fig:nohair_sxs}. For this injected signal the SNR in
other sub-dominant modes is too low to be able to measure them.} \sout{less for us to estimate them reliably.}

The fractional deviations in the estimates of the damping time and
frequency of either mode is expected to be consistent with 0, as we
indeed find in the left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:nohair_sxs}. Consequently we find that the reconstructed
quantities $(\fngr{220}, \taungr{220})$ and $(\fngr{330},
\taungr{330})$ are also consistent with the corresponding predictions
for a BBH merger in GR. As a consequence, the information from these
two independent measures correspond to a unique remnant object, which
is completely described by its mass and spin angular momentum
\abhi{have the mf-af plot as well as a third panel to show
  consistency}. For most of the events observed so far, the power in
the $(3,\pm 3)$ has not been sufficient to measure it along with the
$(2,\pm 2)$, or in fact, in its place. However, it might also be
possible to combine information from multiple observation\sout{, as is
likely} over the coming few years \sout{of GW astronomy with the LIGO-Virgo
detectors,} to obtain meaningful constraints on the $(3,\pm 3)$ and
other sub-dominant QNMs~\cite{}.

\ab{\section{Constraints on QNM frequencies using LIGO-Virgo data}}

\comment{AB: This is the most important section in the paper, because it contains the 
main results of the paper, i.e., the constraints on QNMs using real data. It needs to 
be expanded and results would need to be highlighted much better than in the current version. 
I would like to suggest that besides the Table and the figure with the 2D- and 1D-posteriors 
that you made (which can be contrasted with Fig. 14 of the TGR GWTC-2 paper), we could have 
a new figure that is either a combination of Figs. 5 and 6 or only Fig. 5 of the 
TGR GWTC-2, but for the 22 QNM frequencies for the different GW events. 
Figures can be used in talks, and can capture the information much better 
than a list of numbers in a Table.}

The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration recently released their testing GR
catalogue containing results \sout{of this test} for all events observed
during O3a~\cite{Abbott:2020jks}, which passed a threshold for the
total (source-frame) mass $\geq 50 \Mo$ and SNRs in the pre- and
post-merger regions $\geq 8$.The pre- and post-merger regions of the
signal are identified \sout{as} \ab{from} the \ab{signal's} power \sout{in the frequency content of the
signal} before and after the signal reaches \ab{the} peak\ab{'s} 
amplitude, \sout{as} \ab{which is} determined by the maximum \ab{of the} 
likelihood \ab{function}  \ab{from the} parameter-estimation \ab{analysis} \sout{template}.
\comment{AB: What does it mean ``for the purpose of Ref.''? We are using present tense in the 
entire paper, except perhaps the Conclusions section.} 
For the purpose of Ref.~\cite{Abbott:2020jks}, we use\sout{d} a mass
threshold and restrict\sout{ed} ourselves to the highest-mass events which
\sout{were} \ab{are} expected to be most promising to study merger-ringdown. However,
since our method relies on doing a parameter estimation on the entire
inspiral-merger-ringdown signal, we require the SNR to be beyond a
certain threshold throughout the signal for reliable parameter
estimation of the initial and final quantities. \comment{AB: there are not ``initial'' and ``final'' parameters, 
there are the component masses of the holes in the binary, and the 
mass of the remnant formed after merger.} In fact the SNR
threshold alone should be sufficient for the analysis, and for this
paper we have relaxed the mass threshold. This has added two events,
GW190630$\_$185205 and GW190828$\_$063405, to the list of GW events
considered in \cite{Abbott:2020jks} \abhi{Runs ongoing and looking
  promising}. Fig.~\ref{fig:o1o2_events} shows results from these two
events along with GW190519$\_$153544, GW190521$\_$074359,
GW190910$\_$112807. \comment{AB: Please improve the above paragraph 
and make it clearer which choice is made for the SNR threshold and 
masses, and why.}

\ab{Furthermore}, for the first time, in this paper, we \ab{apply our method to 
measure the QNMs to} \sout{present results on} the relevant
GW events from LIGO-Virgo's O1 and O2 runs, alongside
the above events. Applying the same thresholds as above, we find three
additional events that could be included in the analysis: GW150914,
GW170104, GW170729. The other high-mass events from O1-O2, GW170809,
GW170814, GW170818 and GW170823 do not have an SNR of $8$ in the
merger-ringdown signal. For the three relevant signals, GW150914,
GW170104 and GW170729, we \sout{provide} \ab{show} the posterior distributions in
$(\df{220}, \dtau{220})$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:o1o2_events}. We also
reconstruct the \sout{effective} QNM parameters, $(\fngr{220}, \taungr{220})$
which are tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:qnm_o1o2_results} \footnote{See
  Table IV of Ref.~\cite{Abbott:2020jks} for a list of the SNR
  thresholds. The paper quotes them for the purpose of the IMR
  consistency test, but the same thresholds have been used for the
  $pSEOB$ test, as well.} Among all the GW signals detected so far,
GW150914 (solid curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:o1o2_events}) is unique in its
loudness, \sout{mass as well as the clarity of the signal,} \comment{AB: what 
is the ``clarity'' of a signal?} leading to the
first, and to date, best attempt in measuring the QNM frequencies~\cite{}.

The solid red curve marks the best single-event constraint, GW150914, whereas the contraints from the other events are indicated by the dash-dot curves.

Finally, if we assume that the fractional deviations $(\df{220},
\dtau{220})$ take the same values in multiple events, we can assume
the posterior of one event to be the prior for the next, and obtain a
joint posterior probability distribution. For $N$ observations, where
$P_j(\df{220}, \dtau{220} | d_j)$ is the posterior for the $j$-th
observation corresponding to the data set $d_j$, $j=1,\dots,N$, the joint
posterior is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
P(\df{220}, \dtau{220} | \{d_j\}) = P(\df{220}, \dtau{220}) \prod _{j=1}^N \frac{P(\df{220}, \dtau{220} | d_j) }{P(\df{220}, \dtau{220})}
\end{equation}
%
where $P(\df{220}, \dtau{220})$ is the prior on $(\df{220},
\dtau{220})$. However, since we assume the prior on $(\df{220},
\dtau{220})$ to be flat (or uniform), the joint posterior is equal to
the joint likelihood.

We show these joint likelihoods on $(\df{220}, \dtau{220})$, as well as, the corresponding \ab{1D} marginalized distributions as filled grey curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:o1o2_events}. 
These are the strongest constraints on possible deviations in the measurement of $(\df{220}, \dtau{220})$ to date using our method.\comment{AG: add text on the hierarchical analysis 
if we want to include that analysis. AB: we want to include that analysis.}

\comment{AB: Please write in the text (equations) the results for $(\df{220}, \dtau{220})$ for GW150914, the joint likelihood and the 
hierarchically combined methods.}

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

\comment{AB: I am sorry, but I had no time to write this section. Please write a first draft. I have read in the last week several papers 
about extracting information on the nature of dark objects and gravity in the strong-field regime combining LIGO/Virgo and also 
EHT. I wanted to refer to them --- for example Maggio et al., Volkel et al., Franciolini et al., Cano et al. 
It is also good if we cite papers that have predicted QNMs in gravity theories alternative to GR. We did it in the paper with 
Richard and Vivien.}

\appendix

\section{Study of systematics on ringdown measurements \ab{in real , non-Gaussian noise}}\label{sec:noise_systematics}

\comment{AB: Please improve considerably this Appendix because it is not easy to follow the motivation and the logic. It is written for LIGO people. 
I have tried to make changes but it is better if you do it. I risk to erase parts that you would consider important. Please write it thinking that your 
reader is not an LSC reader!}

In Sec.~\ref{sec:method}, we \ab{discussed} \sout{mentioned that} the expression of the
Bayesian likelihood function \ab{that we use in our analysis} \sout{outlined in} \ab{(see 
Eq.~\ref{eq:likelihood})} \ab{and stressed that it}\sout{and \ref{eq:nwip}} is only valid if the interferometric noise can be
described as a stationary Gaussian process. LIGO-Virgo noise, however,
frequently has non-stationary and/or non-Gaussian features, for
example glitches, which can affect parameter inferences unless
appropriately accounted for. Here we demonstrate\ab{, by injecting in real 
noise a GW190521-like signal} \sout{with an example of a
GW190521-like simulated signal}, \ab{how} systematic biases \ab{can originate} \sout{likely originating}
from an incomplete understanding of the noise. \comment{AB: It is confusing to refer to ``systematic'' 
biases for the noise, generally we refer to systematic biases for the waveform modeling. 
In fact, below you also, somewhat suddenly, refer to (lack of) precession, as a possible source of systemtcis. 
I would advice you to clarify from the beginning of this Appendix, what this study is about and what you intend to 
do below.}

The word ``simulations'' is confusing, because we deal with a paper in which we also refer to NR simulations. I suggest to use ``injected synthetic signals'' instead} of an \texttt{NRSur7dq4} GW signal with parameters similar to the GW event, GW190521, in Gaussian noise (grey dot-dashed lines) and real interferometric noise (pink dot dashed lines). The GR prediction for the frequency and damping time is indicated by the black cross. While the Gaussian noise simulations are consistent with the prediction, at least 3 or the 5 real noise simulation are not. For comparison, we also plot the 90 \% credible level for the actual event, GW190521. \comment{AB: For clarity, please indicate on the plot which waveform model is used to obtain such posteriors, as you did 
in the other plots of the paper. Also, please use something else instead of ``actual event'', which is confusing. The problem is 
that the first two entries of the legend refer to the noise properties of the PE study done with an injected synthetic signal, whereas I believe ``actual event'' refers to ``real'' not injected signal 
and ``real noise''. All the entries in the legend need to be consistent with each other; you need to specify for each of them the ``signal'' and the ``noise''. I hope is clear what I am saying}}

\ab{The spinning, precessing NR-surrogate model \texttt{NRSur7dq4}, valid up to mass ratio 4, was employed 
(together with the $\SEOB$ model) to analyze the GW190521 signal observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors. 
For the injected synthetic signal we use a \texttt{NRSur7dq4} waveform with parameters similar to the ones 
recovered by this model on the actual GW190521 data (see Table I of Ref.~\cite{Abbott:2020tfl}).}  
\ab{In Fig.~\ref{fig:21g_systematics}, we indicate with a black cross what the injected \texttt{NRSur7dq4} signal 
predicts for the $(2,2)$ frequency and damping time, and for comparison, we also 
show with a black solid curve the results obtained when recovering the the actual signal GW190521 with the waveform model $\pSEOB$. As seen in the plot, while 
the measurement of the frequency is consistent with the prediction, we overestimate the damping time.} \comment{AB: it is not clear 
to me what the figure shows. Is the black line the result when running $\pSEOB$ against real data or the 
injection in realt data?}

\comment{AB: What is the ``underlying'' NR signal? I think you are referring to the 
injected signal. Also, until now you have not discussed precession. 
} The underlying NR signal is expected to be precessing, and since the
$\pSEOB$ model is built on an aligned-spin GR model, a lack of
precession could bias measurements. We explore effects of possible
waveform systematics by injecting the signal is coloured Gaussian
noise. In this case, since the understanding of the noise realizations
is complete, any measurement biases could only arise from incomplete
understanding of the \sout{underlying} \ab{injected} signal. We find (grey curves in
Fig.\ref{fig:21g_systematics}) our results to be consistent with the
prediction thus ruling out a lack of precession to be a likely cause
for the bias in the damping time measurement of the actual signal.

We subsequently study the effects of possible noise systematics by
injecting the same \texttt{NRSur7dq4} GW signal in different
realizations of actual interferometric noise around the real event
GW190521. Since the PSDs of the GW detectors are expected to vary over
longer durations of time, we select 5 different noise realizations
over a segment of 2.5 hours of coincident data in both the LIGO
detectors centered at the time of the actual event. The noise
properties in this chunk of data, and consequently for all 5 simulated
signals, is expected to be the closest to that for the actual
event. The results are indicated by \sout{pink} \ab{green} curves in
Fig.~\ref{fig:21g_systematics}. \ab{As it can be seen from the figure,} 
for 3 of the 5 noise realizations,
corresponding to $t_0-1$ hour, $t_0+0.5$ hours, and $t_0+1$ hour we
recover a damping time similar to the actual event, where $t_0$ is the
GPS time of the actual event. For the other two noise realizations, we
estimate the consistent damping time but an off-set frequency, while
the fifth noise realization is consistent with both predictions. The
SNR in the Livingston detector goes down by more than \ab{a factor} 3 in some
runs, indicative of how a variation in the noise strongly affects our
ability to infer parameters. This also seems to indicate that a bias
in the measurements of the damping time for the actual event \comment{AB: not clear 
what you mean} can be unaccounted noise systematics.
